    <p>
      Using broken or weak cryptographic algorithms may compromise
      security guarantees such as confidentiality, integrity, and
      authenticity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many cryptographic algorithms are known to be weak or flawed. The
      security guarantees of a system often rely on the underlying
      cryptography, so using a weak algorithm can have severe consequences.
      For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      If a weak encryption algorithm is used, an attacker may be able to
      decrypt sensitive data.
      </li>
      <li>
      If a weak hashing algorithm is used to protect data integrity, an
      attacker may be able to craft a malicious input that has the same
      hash as a benign one.
      </li>
      <li>
      If a weak algorithm is used for digital signatures, an attacker may
      be able to forge signatures and impersonate legitimate users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This query alerts on any use of a weak cryptographic algorithm that is
      not a hashing algorithm. Use of broken or weak cryptographic hash
      functions are handled by the
      <code>rb/weak-sensitive-data-hashing</code> query.
    </p>

  <recommendation>
    <p>
      Ensure that you use a strong, modern cryptographic
      algorithm, such as AES-128 or RSA-2048.
    </p>
  </recommendation>
  <example>

    <p>
      The following code uses the <code>OpenSSL</code> library to encrypt some
      secret data. When you create a cipher using <code>OpenSSL</code> you must
      specify the encryption algorithm to use. The first example uses DES, which
      is an older algorithm that is now considered weak. The second example uses
      AES, which is a stronger modern algorithm.
